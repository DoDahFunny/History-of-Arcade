    <h2>Pong (1972)</h2>
    <p>
      Created in 1972 by Allan Alcorn, Pong has grown a reputation for its simple design that gets the job done. Famed for being the first commercially successful video game, it has stood the test of time for many years. Inspired by table tennis, players control paddles to bounce a small ball back and forth. Pong ignited the arcade gaming industry and was a main catalyst for the video game revolution in the 70s.
